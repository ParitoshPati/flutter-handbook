# Legacy
**Hack'19**, the first of its kind **International Flutter Hackathon**, organised by the Flutter Community and supported by the Flutter team at Google is just around the corner, and I thought that I should attempt to curate some helpful resources, to help the participants get to speed.


## About Hack'19
If you don't know about Hack'19 then let me give you a brief introduction.

**Hack'19**, to be organised on the **1st of June, 2019**, is the First International Flutter Hackathon, spanning over an entire day. Interested developers can participate in a team of 2-5 people and build something amazing on Flutter or Flutter Web. By the end of the day, all the participants themselves vote for their favourite projects and the winners shall receive amazing prizes. 

Here are some useful links:

4. [Official Getting Started Resources](https://flutterhackathon.com/#getting-started)
   

## Why a Handbook?

At the end of the day, a hackathon is a competition with actual winners, and because it is about Flutter, there will be some really breathtaking UIs, apps with rocket speed performance, and some elements which feel like magic. In a competition like that, you don't want to be missing out, especially when there's a lot of content available online which can help you utilise those hours of coding time that you get, and make the most attractive and useful app.

So, I took the liberty of scavenging the internet, and picking up all the amazing articles, videos, apps, and other helpful resources that can help you achieve that goal. Plus, the scope of this handbook extends beyond hackathons. This will be helpful for any future competition or project, where you are going to use Flutter.

## Firebase

Firebase deserves a separate section because for most people their app will have a backend, but making a custom one from scratch just takes too much time, and considering how well Firebase integrates with Flutter, it becomes the obvious choice.

**Pro Tip**: Skip authentication.
